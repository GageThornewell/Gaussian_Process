# Gaussian_Process
This is code for the GP algorithm. 

I wrote this in my undergraduate in python. This was for my thesis at the time. Different parts of code. I was trying to make the algorithm work more cheaply by using a CUR decomposition, there is some of that code here and ultimately the code for GP is here.
