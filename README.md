# Gaussian_Process
This is code for the GP algorithm. 

I wrote this in my undergraduate in python. This was for my thesis at the time. Different parts of code. I was trying to make the algorithm work more cheaply by using a CUR decomposition, there is some of that code here and ultimately the code for GP is here. GP is a machine learning technique for doing regression. It works using an algorith that is widely availble on the web. The interesting part about GP is does not assume a model for the data, it simply models the data itself. This is very useful for complex data because sometimes there is very little pattern. For example stock data is extremely volatile and here the algorithm would shine. The cost of using the algorithm is quite high, so that is why the research was done to make the algorithm more cheap to use. It does however work, just not on the most complicated physics problems to date. For business though its extremelly optimal.
